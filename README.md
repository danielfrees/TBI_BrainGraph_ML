## Purpose

I am designing/leading my own primary research project (under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Bickart) to: \
•Model mild traumatic brain injury patients brains as graphs \
•Explore differences in topological properties (GT metrics) between traumatic brain injury patients and healthy controls \
•Hypothesize important graph theory metrics to feed as features to an ML algorithm \
•Derive an ML classifier to classify injured brains from healthy ones using graph theoretical metrics as features \


If you have any questions about this project, would like to use/modify my code for a project you are working on, or would otherwise like to get in contact with me, my email is: danielfrees@g.ucla.edu
